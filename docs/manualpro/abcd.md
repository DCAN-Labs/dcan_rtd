# ABCD Study

The Adolescent Beahvior and Cognitive Development (ABCD) neuroimaging dataset is formatted into the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and processed through the [abcd-hcp-pipeline](https://hub.docker.com/r/dcanumn/abcd-hcp-pipeline). The BIDS data, pipeline derivatives, and associated software are all part of the ABCD-BIDS Community Collection (Collection 3165). A detailed description of this dataset and image processing pipeline can be found at the [ABCC readthedocs](https://collection3165.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
