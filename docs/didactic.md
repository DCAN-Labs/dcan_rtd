### **[Interrogating Multivariate Patterns of Functional Connectivity Related to Age in the Newborn Brain](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ui6mGOpxizNeTkHh_hb3kwb8GvwjJ-Hq/view?usp=sharing)**

*Ashley Nielsen* - May 3, 2021

Multivariate patterns of functional connectivity across the brain in children and adults carry information about maturation and/or experience that have been used to accurately predict an individual’s age. In this project, we test if functional connectivity carries such information in the newborn brain during the first month of life (38-46 weeks postmenstrual age) and interrogate what networks are important for age prediction. We also investigate the contribution of other potential sources of differences in functional connectivity related to age such as gestational age at birth, head motion, and brain size.

### **[An Introduction to Time-to-Event Analysis, with Neuroimaging Applications](https://drive.google.com/file/d/177hLEL0iil-aRN8L-k5OkLi7hWZImxBN/view?usp=sharing)**

*[Mark Fiecas](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/mark-fiecas)* - April 19, 2021

Longitudinal designs are becoming more common, and they make it possible to ask research questions related to the occurrence and timing of events. Time-to-event analyses, however, are not common in the neuroimaging literature. In this presentation, I will give an overview on the basic concepts of time-to-event analyses, and I will give an example using the cortical thickness data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to model its association with time-to-conversion from mild cognitive impairment.

### **[Infants’ Gaze Exhibits a Fractal Structure that Varies by Age and Stimulus Salience: a Complexity Science Approach](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Q16zK8XPxKQNZRnKw-yQTz8ZDuUyFYc/view?usp=sharing)**

The development of selective visual attention is critical for effectively engaging with an ever-changing world. Its optimal deployment depends upon interactions between neural, motor, and sensory systems across multiple timescales and neurocognitive loci. Previous work illustrates the spatio-temporal dynamics of these processes in adults, but less is known about this emergent phenomenon early in life. Using data (n = 190; 421 visits) collected between 3 and 35 months of age, we examined the spatio-temporal complexity of young children’s gaze patterns as they viewed stimuli varying in semantic salience. This presentation will share results from this paper (recently published in Scientific Reports) and provide an overview of a complexity science approach to studying human systems that we believe has the potential for broader application throughout the developmental and cognitive sciences. 

### **[Inherited Genetic Liability for Autism and Infant Brain Development](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17sL2mcuzTm4WABAwMFzyngbUtFs7bdI2/view?usp=sharing)**

*[Jessica Girault](https://www.med.unc.edu/psych/directory/jessica-girault/)* - March 9, 2021

Prospective studies of infant siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have demonstrated that atypical brain development precedes the defining behavioral symptoms of the disorder. The infant sibling study design provides a powerful framework to determine what is “familial” in autism by placing the infant sibling in the context of the family and family genetics. This presentation will share findings demonstrating that the phenotypic severity of older siblings with autism can inform neurodevelopmental trajectories in their younger siblings.

Presenting the relationship between ventricular, subcortical and cortical volumes to objective measures of balance and gait.

### **[Automated Analysis of Infant Brain Imaging Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEsBLq_gpIjKnW1X33VZ77bc14DLULsk/view?usp=sharing)**

*[Lilla Zollei](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/user/6462)* - December 14, 2020

The development of automated tools for brain morphometric analysis in infants is a complex and challenging task that has lagged significantly behind analogous tools for adults. Nevertheless, there is a great need for automated image-processing tools to quantify differences between infant groups and other individuals, because aberrant cortical morphologic measurements have been associated with neuropsychiatric, neurologic, and developmental disorders in children. This presentation will introduce an automated segmentation and surface extraction pipeline designed to accommodate clinical MRI studies of infant brains in a population 0-2 year-olds. Additionally, recent algorithmic advancements using deep learning solutions will be discussed along with future application directions related to infant brain development.

Discussion of work-in-progress on the development of a whole-brain connectivity (polyconn) score derived from brain-wide association results and its relationship to ADHD symptoms.

### **[Gender, Racial, and Ethnic Imbalance in Neuroscience Reference Lists](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14yRnFNhWlks1LdBSAVHk-Df_GRsxZ_wp/view?usp=sharing)**

*[Max Bertolero](https://maxbertolero.org/) and [Jordan Dworkin](https://jordandworkin.com/)* - November 2, 2020

Discrimination against racial and ethnic minority groups exists in the academy, and the associated biases impact hiring and promotion, publication rates, grant funding, and awards. Precisely how racial and ethnic bias impacts the manner in which the scientific community engages with the ideas of academics in minority groups has yet to be fully elucidated. Citations are a marker of such community engagement, as well as a currency used to attain career milestones. We assessed the extent and drivers of racial and ethnic imbalance in the reference lists of papers published in five top neuroscience journals over the last 25 years.

### **[Towards Reproducible Brain-Wide Association Studies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cB8h4gImhfxw2lUFf4FWbPG9vsWe4QJ1/view?usp=sharing)**

*[Scott Marek](https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/scott-marek)* - October 5, 2020

Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N=11,878), we estimated the effect sizes and reproducibility of these brain-wide associations studies (BWAS) as a function of sample size. The very largest, replicable brain-wide associations for univariate and multivariate methods were r=0.14 and r=0.34, respectively. In smaller subsamples, typical for BWAS, effect sizes were ubiquitously inflated due to sampling variability, causing widespread replication failure. Sample sizes of N⪆2,000 are required to provide stable and reproducible brain-behavioral phenotype associations. While investigator-initiated brain-behavior research continues to generate hypotheses and propel innovation, large consortia are needed to usher in a new era of reproducible BWAS.
